> This dashboard was produced to provide further details on intra-college transfers - what % of students are changing major, changing department, or dropping out. The data reveals that there are some majors where very few students persist in that major to the second year of study, or to the point of graduation. This level of detail is often not apparent when looking at overall retention or graduation rates by major as the criteria for such metrics is typically whether or not the student is still enrolled, rather than whether they are enrolled in the same program. 
> Data was extracted from our data warehouse (SQL Server 2012), with cleaning and transformations done at the point of extraction. Visualizations were created in Power BI using DAX queries to produce percentages within majors.

> Dashboard for the President showing Student Enrollment (5 years), Retention Rate (3 years) and Graduation Rate (3 years) by Sex and Ethnicity.
> Student enrollment and Award data was extracted from our data warehouse (SQL Server 2012). A subset of records was selected for analysis in SQL, and aggregate statistics were calculated. The data was then imported to Power BI for visualization.

>I worked closely with the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies to design, develop and test this report which shows data on student withdrawals from courses in the current semester. This report helped him to identify students who may be at risk for dropping out, to reach out to them in a timely manner.
>Report created in Visual Studio with connection to SQL Server Database. Report was deployed to SQL Server Reporting Services for on-demand access by end user. Exported Excel version of the report is shown here in Google Sheets. Identifiable information has been removed.
